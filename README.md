## MAgNET: A Graph U-Net Architecture for Mesh-Based Simulations  

This repository provides the implementations of "[MAgNET: A Graph U-Net Architecture for Mesh-Based Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00713)".

<br />

## Dependencies

Scripts have been tested running under Python 3.10.9, with the following packages installed (along with their dependencies). In addition, CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN 7 have been used.


- `tensorflow-gpu==2.4.1`
- `keras==2.4.3`
- `numpy==1.24.2`
- `pandas==1.3.4`
