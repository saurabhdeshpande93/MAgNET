## MAgNET: A Graph U-Net Architecture for Mesh-Based Simulations  

This repository provides the implementations of "[MAgNET: A Graph U-Net Architecture for Mesh-Based Simulations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197624002136?via%3Dihub)".

MAgNET is a graph U-Net architecture composed of two novel deep learning layers. The first layer is the Multichannel Aggregation (MAg) layer, which expands upon the idea of multichannel localized operations in convolutional neural networks to accommodate arbitrary graph-structured inputs. And second type of layers are pooling/unpooling layers, designed to facilitate efficient learning on high-dimensional inputs by utilizing reduced representations of arbitrary graph-structured inputs.
